I had lots of fun with this assignment. This was about learning how to make timers and use those timers to build websites. In this example I made a quiz about Keanu Reeves that demonstrated my knowledge of timers, radio buttons, and css. The tricky thing with 
 this app was to make it so that it didnt count every empty radio button as an unanswered question. Bootstrap was the main resource I used for the front end.
